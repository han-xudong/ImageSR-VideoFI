Super-Resolution and Interpolation Program

This is an program that could do image super-resoltuion, video super-resolution and video frame interpolation.

There are three major algorithms used in the program, which are bicubic interpolation method, super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and phase-based video frame interpolation (PBVI).

The file "SuperResolution_and_Interpolation_exported" is the main function, and just run it to do everything.
The file "ImageSR" consists of a function used for super-resolution, where exists two algorithms bicubic interpolation and SRCNN.
The file "VideoIP" consists of a function used for video frame interpolation.
The folder "Bicubic" consists of several files that combines to be the bicubic interpolation method.
The folder "SRCNN" consists of several files that combines to be the SRCNN.
The folder "PBVI" consists of several files that combines to be the PBVI.
The folder "SRCNNmodel" consists model data of SRCNN.
The folder "matlabPylTools" consists a toolbox that used by PBVI.
The folder "Temp" is used for containing some images when disposing videos.
