# Image Super Resolution and Video Frame Interpolation

## Summary
The project realized the image super-resolution based onbicubic interpolation and SRCNN, and also realized the frame interpolation based on phase-based method. And a friendly GUI was created. The project achieved the expected target with practicability. Further, it can be optimized in terms of computing speed, training set, and neural network, so as to provide a better experience.

## Document Explanation
- **Code**: contains the code for image super resolution and frame interpolation
- **Image**: contains the images used in the paper for explaining the results
- **Output**: contains the origin images and images operated by PBVI and SRCNN
- **PPT**: contains the PPT pages for presentation
